I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Finance at the London School of Economics. I will be available on the 2020/21 Academic Job Market. My job market paper can be found [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

My interests are in Financial Intermediations, Behavioural Finance and Public Finance.
